1. Install the latest [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
2. Install the latest [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Run `dotnet new install Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template` to install the project template
4. Create a folder for your solution and cd into it (the template will use it as project name)
